At home, I keep my things where they belong, and there's a place for everything.I am also a frequent traveler.And when I travel, something goes wrong. My neatness turns into something else. It all starts innocently enough. I pack everything perfectly. Underwear here, shorts in a stack, tshirts on the left, dress shirts and slacks on the right, toiletries on the top. Then, once I get to the hotel and change clothes, the whole case is in shambles. And it only gets worse. If I'm on a week-long trip, I'm doomed by day 3.Now, enter the Shacke Packing Cubes! What a brilliant idea, and yet such a simple one. Pack packs in your pack! These little wonders have allowed me to compartmentalize my suitcase in a way that the little zippered pockets around the sides never did. I just put each category of clothes (i.e. shorts, underwear, etc.) it its own \"cube\". Then, when I need a pair of boxers, I just go straight to the source and pull one out. No hunting, no pecking. And no suitcase that already looks like a laundry basket at the start of the trip.In conclusion, these are so good, I've got to order myself a second set.[sample provided for an honest review]</td>\n",

Easy to pull out, easy to unpack. I like the addition of the laundry bag but it is pretty small. I like using it for shoes, which I don't like having floating around in my suitcase. Or it will fit a few unmentionables and maybe a couple of shirts.

The nylon fabric is tough and water-resistant and the ventilating mesh on top is snag-resistant.I have been looking at packing cubes in different stores and online for several years, and these are the most thoughtfully-designed ones that I've seen, both overall and particularly for the four-inch depth.A sample was provided for evaluation and review</td>\n",

How wonderful not to have my luggage look all a clutter.The set comes with a laundry bag, which I admit is a bit small for a family, or even a single person who's packed for more than a weekend trip.  Bags on trips will always find a purpose, though.  I used it to haul my supplies from the cabin to the showers.The Shack Pak bags are getting a good workout, as we are basically running them through three separate vacations this month.  I'm still using them and my daughter will be using it next week.I like the mesh that lets us see what's inside without opening the bags.  The zippers are solid and the nylon is durable.  The bags are taking a beating and holding up well.  When done, they will nest inside each other neatly, ready for our next trip.This product was provided for review by Shacke.</td>\n",

              "      <td>When I signed up to receive a free set of Shacke Pak for review I thought to myself &amp;#34;What the heck am I taking this for? I don't do any travel, don't do any vacations, and don't even go out to do laundry.&amp;#34; I suppose it was the desire to posses more &amp;#34;goodies&amp;#34; that truly drove me, but man was I happy when I cracked the plastic bag and checked these bad boys out.What impressed me the most, (and I will keep this review short to save people the agony of reading my diatribe) was the size in comparison to other travel bags and their portability. When looking at the package it appears as though you may be thoroughly disappointed, but the second you crack these bags open you watch in amazement as they expand and truly do hold large quantities of goods. I received my free packing cube set on June 7th and have been using them for little things ever since. Whether it's carrying my uniform into work, bringing clothes down to the laundry room, or moving items around to better organize and keep these together these bags are tough, they are durable, and they are convenient.I am truly pleased with this Shacke product, and had it been the other way around--with me looking for some good travel/storage bags, this is where I would go.5 Agile, Mobile, and Versatile Stars out of 5!</td>\n",
